Non-Convolutional-Model:

Run #1:
	Settings:
	Epochs = 50
	Learning Rate = 0.01
	Validation Split = 0.2
	Batch Size = 256

	Notes:
	The First epoch is the slowest, 2ms/step whilst the rest are 1ms/step.
	Loss decreases pretty rapidly in the beginning. From 1.8717 to 1.1499 to 0.7855 within only three (3) epochs.
	Accuracy also increases pretty rapidly. 0.4001 to 0.7349 to 0.8248 within three epochs.
	Val_loss: 1.4338 -> 0.8800 -> 0.6505
	Val_accuracy: 0.6294 -> 0.8172 -> 0.8547

	In 50 epochs the non-conv AI manages to reach 0.2396 loss and 0.9314 accuracy.


Convolutional Model:

Run #1:
	Settings:
	Epochs = 50
	Learning Rate = 0.01
	Validation Split = 0.2
	Batch Size = 256
	Kernel Size = (8, 8)

	Notes:
	First epoch had 1.4957 loss and 0.6237 accuracy.
	Every epoch took about 5 seconds and varied between 28-29ms/step. The first epoch took the longest at 6 seconds.
	The accuracy went to 0.9 pretty fast in only 7 epochs.
	In 50 epochs the conv AI managed to hit a loss of 0.1093 and an accuracy of 0.9691.
	This AI model is definitely much slower so far with these settings.
